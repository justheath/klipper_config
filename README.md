# klipper_config

My klipper configs for Creality 4.2.7 board with TH3D EZABL and Tough Extruder on an Ender 3 Pro.

## About

Recent convert to Klipper looking to speed up printing without noticeable loss in quality. I print for fun, sometimes functional things, 
or when a friend needs something. Still printing *mostly* other people's models while I learn how to use various modelling and design tools. 

While I enjoy upgrading the printer, I prefer that it remain functional more often than not. So no major changes are planned; just 
small, quick improvements. And I suck at soldering. 

## Configuration

I prefer to keep my configuration files separate based on purpose. It helps me find the settings I'm looking to change and 
keeps me from accidentally changing something else. Currently, most macros are in the `macros.cfg` file, except for the 
original macros provided by fluidd which remain in `fluidd.cfg`. 

As I learn more about Klipper and find other useful macros, I might split them into multiple files, 
either 1 per file or keep related ones together. 

## Hardware

- Ender 3 Pro
  - TH3D EZABL
  - TH3D Tough Extruder
- Raspberry Pi 4 w/ 4GB
- Kuman 7" LCD
- RaspiCam v1.2 or v1.3

## KlipperScreen

I'm using KlipperScreen with a Kuman 7" LCD connected to HDMI on my Raspberry 4. 

My only changes are for custom filament settings.
